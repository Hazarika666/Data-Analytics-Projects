# Data-Analytics-Projects

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under the influence of :
'Self learning activities' by searching and implementing datasets and its analysis, 
Under Skillslash Academy's accalaimed course - Data Science with Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning which spans for a period of 12 months,
And, under Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree course syllabus roof.

Skillslash Academy & Udacity's online Data Science and Data analyst program prepares me for a career as a industry ready data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

# Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis

Subjects Covered in these portfolio of projects :

Anaconda
Jupyter Notebook
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes

# Project 1: Explore Weather Trends with weather forecast data

In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings. ( It may be better to place this section inside the readme of the project 1)

# Project 2: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.

I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.

# Part 2 -Practical Statistics

Subjects Covered:

Probability
Conditional Probability
Binominal Distribution
Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
Descriptive Statistics
Inferential Statistics
Confidence Levels and Intervals
Hypothesis Testing
T-tests and A/B test
Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Logistic Regression

#Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv

Using Python, I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one.

# Part 3 - Data Extraction and Wrangling

Subjects Covered:

GATHERING DATA:
1: Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
2: Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
3: Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database

ASSESSING DATA
1: Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
2: Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
3: Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity

CLEANING DATA
1: Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
2: Clean data using Python and pandas
3: Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python

#Project 4 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data

Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.

# Part 4 - Data Visualisation

Subjects Covered:

1: Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales )
2: Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
3: Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
4: Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data , polish plots , create slide deck )

# Project 5: Data Visulization with Diamond Data

Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

# Project 6: Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data

In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
